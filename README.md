Hi, I'm Fantine.

I am a research engineer specializing in the intersection of AI and real-world applications. 
I am currently at Google DeepMind working on large language models. 
Before joining Google DeepMind, I was principal engineer at SambaNova Systems, designing algorithms and computational methods for performing blazing-fast math on their unique AI hardware stack. I got a Ph.D. in Geophysics from Stanford University and a Master in Science and Executive
                        Engineering
                        from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de Paris. I recently got awarded Top AI Researcher 2024 by Women in AI Netherlands.

                    <p>I have moved around, spending
                        time living in the Netherlands, France, Japan, and the United States. Somewhere
                        in there, I
                        found the time to get my helicopter license.

                        When I am not doing science or writing code, I enjoy <a href="http://instagram.com/fantine.art"
