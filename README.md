Iâ€™m Fantine Huot, a geophysicist and computer scientist based in San Francisco.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Geophysics at Stanford University. My work focuses on the intersection between Seismology and Deep Learning. I got a M.S. my Science and Executive Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de Paris, and worked for a couple years as a software engineer in Paris before starting my PhD. 

I hope you enjoy my website. It is currently under construction, so stay tuned for more content.

## Announcements

* My paper ["Automatic noise exploration in urban areas"](https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/segam2017-17774369.1) has been selected for the Award of Merit for Best Student Poster Paper Presented at the 2017 SEG Annual Meeting. 

* ["A Seismic Shift in Scalable Acquisition Demands New Processing: Fiber-Optic Seismic Signal Retrieval in Urban Areas with Unsupervised Learning for Coherent Noise Removal"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310692/) was published in the Mar. 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine special issue on subsurface exploration.
