Hi, I'm Fantine.

I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in computational earth sciences at Stanford University, working on research at the intersection of deep learning and seismology. I hold a Master in Science and Executive Engineering from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de Paris.

Previously, I was with Google, Chevron, Schlumberger, Actimage, and Valeo. I have moved around, spending time living in the Netherlands, France, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States. Somewhere in there, I got my helicopter license.

When I am not doing science or writing code, I enjoy [drawing fantasy creatures](https://www.instagram.com/piecrustinator_).
